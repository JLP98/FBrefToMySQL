# FBrefToMySQL
A script which downloads football player statistics from fbref.com into csv files and creates a new MySQL database ready to import the csv files as tables.

MASSIVE THANKS to https://fbref.com/en/ for providing a huge library of up-to-date player statistics for free public use. 

NOTE: Make sure to install Puppeteer before running the scripts: run "npm install puppeteer".
